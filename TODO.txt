WE ARE MISSING...

-[SQL?] A way to announce winner of an auction once the auction ends. (Express mailer). Interrupt/There should be some 
	kind of function constantly comparing current time with auction end for all items? Though this sounds like this 
	could take some time to process for large DBs...
	Check out this link: http://railscasts.com/episodes/206-action-mailer-in-rails-3
	Though it needs Ruby on Rails (and Heroku needs it too)
	I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17888268/javascript-countdown-timer-for-auction-site

-[C][H] Generate list of products for 'ViewPurchaseHistory'
-[C] Implement a way to set primary addresses and primary ccards
-[H] Generate list of ratings for ratings page. (app.js)
-[C] Update address, update ccard, update product, app.js for form parsing
-[H] Generate lis of product bids on content divider #product-bidding-list

-[B] Use Heroku to run app directly from the web
-[B] Export app to Android

KNOWN MAJOR ISSUES
-Fix RES JSON alerts during errors (for some reason they say 'undefined' instead of showing the correct message!!)

MINOR ISSUES
-Sorting is not implemented
-Sometimes clicking back will leave you in limbo (particularly when managing ccards and addresses)
-Sometimes user avatar will be briefly shown between pages (linked to the previous one)
-Login button doesn't always show the login popup


REMINDERS/DETAILS

-A distinction should be made between deleting a product and running out of a product; the delete-a-product option
 will be used when the seller will no longer sell instances of said product; if available quantity of a product
 reaches 0 at any point, it should be hidden from the product list but not deleted from the system since the seller
 might later want to update said item (when restocking takes place). (update browse so that it only populates the
 list with items whose pquantity != 0)

-Users shouldn't be able to rate seller more than once, but can edit the rating if they later buy more from seller. 
 Only ratings from verified purchases can be accepted.
 
-List of user bids should probably show both your bid and the highest current bid. Or current highest bid: amount and username.

-Sales page should only show your sales as a seller, unless you're an admin (and so you can see everything).

-[W] Currently the ER diagram is not consistent with our database (Fix foreign key issues)
