WE ARE MISSING...

-[SQL][C][H] A way to announce winner of an auction once the auction ends. (Express mailer). Interrupt/There should be some 
	kind of function constantly comparing current time with auction end for all items? Though this sounds like this 
	could take some time to process for large DBs...

-[SQL][C][H] Implement 'Checkout'. Should ask user for ccard to be used, and address where items are to be shipped to (get/set 
    primary address and ccard?)

-[SQL][C][H] Implement 'PlaceOrder'. Create sale, invoice, invoicecontent entries, empty cart, decrement product quantity by 
    the quantity just bought (products table). Do not allow buying more than is available.

-[C] Fix issues with 'Rate user' (I think this is a form data parsing issue)

-[H] Ratings page.

-[SQL][C][H] Implement 'ViewItemBids', which will show current bids on a particular item. Should probably be a button in the 
	item's product page. Hide button if product is not in auction.

-[SQL][C][H] Implement one-click buy (I guess this DOES require a primary address and ccard). Should at least show an alert ("Are you 
    ABSOLUTELY sure you want to buy this product? Quick summary: [Item][Total][primAddress][primCard] There is no going 
    back D:"). It will be an on-steroids version of placeOrder() without the step-by-step process. Actually, it WILL be 
    placeOrder() WITHOUT the checkout sequence.

-[SQL][C][H] Implement sorting and searching in browse.

-[SQL][C][H] Implement 'ViewPurchaseHistory' to view history of your purchases.

-[H] Update address, update ccard, update product forms.

-[B] Use Heroku to run app directly from the web

-[B] Export app to Android


KNOWN MINOR ISSUES

-Sometimes clicking back will leave you in limbo (particularly when managing ccards and addresses)

-Sometimes user avatar will be briefly shown between pages (linked to the previous one)

-Login button doesn't always show the login popup


REMINDERS/DETAILS

-Delete product should delete the product from all possible tables where a product could be.

-A distinction should be made between deleting a product and running out of a product; the delete-a-product option
 will be used when the seller will no longer sell instances of said product; if available quantity of a product
 reaches 0 at any point, it should be hidden from the product list but not deleted from the system since the seller
 might later want to update said item (when restocking takes place). (update browse so that it only populates the
 list with items whose pquantity != 0)

-Users shouldn't be able to rate seller more than once, but can edit the rating if they later buy more from seller. 
 Only ratings from verified purchases can be accepted.
 
-List of user bids should probably show both your bid and the highest current bid.

-Sales page should only show your sales as a seller, unless you're an admin (and so you can see everything).

-[W] Currently the ER diagram is not consistent with our database (Fix foreign key issues)

-[W] Look into jQuery/Q.Js promises for parallel(asynchronous) queries/ajax requests (THEY DON'T CALL IT JQUERY FOR 
 NUTHIN' {just kidding [no, not really]})
 
-I strongly believe, since there is one invoice per sale, that sales and invoices should be merged into a single table;
 this would make inserts a lot easier when orders are processed
